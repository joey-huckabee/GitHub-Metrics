# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding: Poetry packaging, CLI entry point, tooling
  configuration (black, isort, ruff, pylint, mypy, vulture, pytest), pre-commit
  hooks, and GitHub Actions CI.
- `github-metrics repo OWNER/NAME` collects point-in-time repository metrics.
- `github-metrics rate-limit` reports remaining API budget.
- `github_metrics.logger` with `LogLevels`, a re-runnable `reset_logger()`, and a
  deprecated `Logger` wrapper kept for older callers.
- `-V` as a short alias for `--version`, the version in the `--help` banner, and a
  `tool_version` field on every `RepositoryMetrics` snapshot.

### Changed

- Python 3.14 is now a required CI target rather than `continue-on-error`; it passed
  on the first run.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` to v7, `actions/setup-python` to v7,
  `actions/upload-artifact` to v7, and `github/codeql-action` to v4.
- The CLI configures logging through `reset_logger()` instead of
  `logging.basicConfig()`.
